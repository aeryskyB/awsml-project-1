# Udacity AWS Machine Learning Fundamentals: project-1

It was the first project of this nanodgree.  

We were instructed to use [Autogluon](https://auto.gluon.ai/stable/index.html) for training models for the Kaggle [bike-sharing-demand](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand/overview) competition.  
The data had to be retrieved using **jupyter CLI**, then read and preprocessed as required.  

Afterwards, we had to perform -
  * EDA
  * model training (using [`TabularPredictor`](https://auto.gluon.ai/stable/api/autogluon.tabular.TabularPredictor.html))
  * hyperparameter optimization  
  * and a few more things...
